            Portraying real people on media not only creates better connections between brands and people, but it also, and most importantly, changes our inner perceptions and self-acceptance for good.
            <br>
            <br>
            Unfortunately, model and casting companies still just receiving portfolios from people that only fulfill traditional beauty standards. Receiving is easier than recruiting. 
            Maybe that's why there's a lack of diversity in their portfolio.
            That's where we come in, to break the wheel. 
            <br>
            <br>
            We want to create a portfolio of real people at the disposition of any producer in order to finally have representation in media.
