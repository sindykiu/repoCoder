        <h2>WHY ARE WE HERE?</h2>
        <p>We're finally beginning to understand the power of representation. 
        Portraying "real people" on media not only creates better connections between brands and people, but it also, and most importantly, changes our inner perceptions and self-acceptance for good.
        </p>
        <p>Unfortunately, model and casting companies still just receiving portfolios from people that only fulfill traditional beauty standards. Receiving is easier than recruiting. 
        Maybe that's why there's a lack of diversity in their portfolio.</p>
        <p>That's where we come in, to break the wheel. 
        We want to create a portfolio of "real people" at the disposition of any producer in order to finally have representation in media.</p>
